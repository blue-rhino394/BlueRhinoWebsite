**Project Goals**

Create a web app for the eco-conscious consumer or profesional through the use of online business cards. 

As people grow towards becoming all online, the amount of platforms we must keep up with has become overwhelming. Imagine the simplicity of having that all in one place, all on one card. That's what we hope to provide to today's busy professionals, students, and consumers; an all in one platform to share your information or to find it.
